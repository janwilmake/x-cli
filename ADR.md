We are bound by the X API ratelimit for posting, which is:

- FREE: 17/day
- $200/month: 1667/day
- $5000/month: 10000/day
- Enterprise (starting at $42k/month): depends on use-case, unknown.

We have a few options:

1. charge per month for posting from the CLI - big commitment even if used infrequently
2. charge per tweet with freemium model, trying 20 tweets for free first.
3. offer for free as addition to xymake. $200/month plan could allow 100 active users for free.
