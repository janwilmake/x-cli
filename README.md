# XYMake CLI

## Stay in flow. Post to X without leaving your editor.

XYMake CLI is the developer's companion for sharing your work on X directly from your terminal. No more context switching, no more distractions‚Äîjust seamless integration between your code and your audience.

### üîÑ Post as you code

With a simple command `xy`, create threads about your repository as you build it. XYMake intelligently tracks your projects, creating organized threads tied to your repositories.

```bash
$ xy Just implemented a new feature that solves...
```

### üßµ Smart threading

XYMake automatically maintains context between your posts, creating coherent threads based on your repository. It knows when to continue an existing thread or start a new one.

### üî® Built for developers

- Stays within your workflow - never leave your editor
- Repository-aware threading
- Automatic repo linking in threads
- Maintains your coding flow state

### ‚ö° The X distraction eliminator

The average developer loses hours to social media distractions daily. XYMake CLI gives you the power to engage with your audience without falling into the attention trap.

```bash
# Share your work without opening X
$ xy Just fixed that pesky bug everyone was talking about

# Post without creating a thread
$ xy -n Sharing this thought independently of my current project

# Open your current thread in browser when needed
$ xy open
```

## Why XYMake CLI?

**üß† Stay in flow state** - Post directly from your terminal without breaking your concentration

**‚è±Ô∏è Save hours daily** - No more getting lost in feeds and notifications

**üöÄ Build in public effectively** - Share your progress naturally as part of your workflow

## Get started in seconds

```bash
$ npm install -g xymake
$ xy setup
```

XYMake CLI connects to your X account securely through OAuth. Your first post is just one command away.

## Origin story - February + March 2025

I came up with the idea of making a CLI for posting on X on February 10 after seeing someone posting one on X and seeing it was very hard to use (having to make a client/token etc), but didn't spend much time trying it. I didn't think much of the time. But as time went on, the idea of doing more with the X platform developed further. Among other things, I built https://threads.forgithub.com and around that time I also met @brianships who made https://socialdata.tools. One of the things we talked about is the following (Source: https://xymake.com/janwilmake/status/1903776061239767211)

> @janwilmake - 3/23/2025, 11:49:18 AM: The hardest skill I am trying to master right now is knowing when to turn X on and when to turn X off again. If only there were a tool that could tell me this based on certain metrics on activity of my X account ü§î cc @brianships

> @brianships - 3/23/2025, 6:55:09 PM: I think it's actually pretty easy to make an agent that will review posts for you and ping you when there is something relevant/important:

> 1. Create a Twitter list of accounts that post something relevant to your work
> 2. Use our search endpoint to fetch recent tweets from this list (query = "list:LIST_ID"). I would probably also filter tweets based on a min number of likes to reduce noise
> 3. Send each tweet through an LLM to assess it's relevance
> 4. Generate an overview with links to relevant tweets and send it to email/Discord/etc.

After that, my brain started running wild. Just like I have all these ideas for github, I had so many ideas for twitter! Within a few days from this post, I built https://xymake.com into a real product built on top of https://socialdata.tools.

# Update 2025-03-27

Brian tipped me about someone building an API going from commits to tweets through an LLM. I talked with him, but wasn't convinced. My brain started racing again. Just a CLI and spend $0.05 per post. What about that? _Main insight: I don't need to gatewall X if I don't have a reason to leave my editor to get stuff done on X!_ And what if it were connected to your repo you are working on, via the cwd? Wow. This idea just became good. Looking at this now, even think it's much more relevant than when I looked last time. Also I have a better idea on how to do it now. I need to reduce 2 interfaces to 1, enabling posting while disabling feed and notifications! I just need the following to make a POC.

It's feasible since im probably already using OAuth 1.0 User Context - https://docs.x.com/resources/fundamentals/authentication/overview

If I can't use that context, I need to get basic ($200 per month) for multi-users, but probably it's fine with free (it seems up to 17 tweets per user per 24 hours, which means I can also do it without DO scheduler, just doing it instantly)

Ratelimit info:

The post tweet API itself with OAuth is also great for later for other things! So let's get started, hopefully tomorrow (it's 1:13 AM now, going to bed, feeling accomplished about this great idea).... üò¥

## POC (2025-03-28)

‚ùóÔ∏è The potential impact is huge: saving hours (!!) of distractions every day, staying in flow in the editor. ü§Ø

API

- ‚úÖ X oauth on xymake.com that uses DO (done)
- ü§Ø After some testing and digging, it seems that the user-based ratelimit is only available to enterprise through the 1.1 api: https://devcommunity.x.com/t/v1-1-api-no-longer-working/199890/3
- ‚úÖ Expose endpoint to tweet. Either new tweet or comment on given id. will queue using the DO alarms to prevent hitting ratelimits. use https://docs.x.com/x-api/posts/creation-of-a-post.
- ‚úÖ Finalised the initial API structure - reply, quote, or new! It works!

[![](chatgpt-tweet.jpeg)](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1905239936082518410)

CLI

- package `npm i -g xymake` with bin `xy`
- CLI that requests API key or opens browser, sets it in global config location
- keep state of last tweet id + date per repo in `xymake.json` in repo.
- CLI `xy ...` to send a tweet. uses current git of current folder to know if its a thread or not. will start new thread if the latest one is over a day ago (but will quote old one). will always attach tweets to repos by adding the repo url in the second tweet.

## BACKLOG

Easy onboarding

- New page for dashboard with API key for CLI.
- Generate and show API key and scopes are shown as well
- New landingpage https://cli.xymake.com that explains the X CLI

Validation

- Already validated from myself. let's start by trying it myself and see if it sticks.

More CLI

- `xy history [n]` to get the latest thread (or multiple) and read through it as markdown (also seeing all comments)
- `xy ship ...` to send a tweet but also ship changes to git with the same tweet.
- `xy snap` to make a screenshot
- `xy ./path.png ...` to upload photo/video with comment, or turn a text file into a thread, or add a link to a file!
- Maybe can even do line number annotations and have it make screenshots of these sections. That'd be a killer feature. `xy ./path.ts:10-20 ...`
- `xy yap` to record, transcribe, send
- `xy find` to find relevant tweets from the cli and show them as numbered threads, allowing easy responding (uses `forgithub.threads`)
- Features to improve tweets further somehow, e.g. based on relevant files, auto-tagging people, etc.
- `xy prompt` to allow AI to write/suggest the tweet (in different ways, e.g. based on changes - cc https://tweetgit.com https://x.com/dzhohola)
- someone like https://x.com/yagiznizipli posts all PRs on X and that also kinda works but X wants X. branch detection is definitely required to determine the thread!

Monetisation

- For free users, add advertisement to second message of a thread.
- Charge $0.05 per tweet for paid users, pay as you go. someone like me that ships and tweets 50+ times daily, that's $75 per month.
